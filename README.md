===============

A PHP script for backup/download all images from one or a list of tumblr accounts

So far, this is the first commit, and obviously there are many things 
that I'm going to try to improve in the coming days.

btw, sorry about my english :)

how to use it?
===============
Save in a file (like samples.txt) one, or a list of tumblr accounts (one per line).

After, just run:

'php php-tumblr-dwld.php samples.txt'
